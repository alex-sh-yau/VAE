Variational Autoencoder for generating financial time-series data

This repository contains the files for the latest version of the Variation Autoencoder
project worked on at OPTrust from September-December 2018.

The purpose of this project is to use a deep neural network to learn historical
time-series financial data in order to create alternate varied data for the same assets in a given asset class.

Because historical financial data is so limited, this significantly constrains ML models that rely on it.
Being able to generate varied but realistic data for something like historical price time series
can drastically improve ML models for trading, stock picking, portfolio/risk allocation among others.
